                <p>Meditation is an ancient practice that dates back thousands of years. Despite its age, this practice is common worldwide because it has benefits for brain health and overall well-being. With the help of modern technology, researchers continue to expand their understanding of how meditation helps people and why it works.
                Buddhist: Several different forms of meditation have their origins in Buddhism (which is considered both a philosophy and a religion, especially depending on the nation of origin). Theravadan meditation is more common in Southeast Asia, especially in India and Thailand. Zen Buddhist meditation originated in China, and different forms of it eventually evolved elsewhere, such as Japanese Zen Buddhist meditation. Tibetan Buddhist tantric meditation comes from the former nation of Tibet, now an autonomous region of China.
                Christian: Contemplation, which is when you focus intently on a question, idea, religious concept or deity, is a common practice in Christianity. Praying is often classified as meditation, especially when it takes this form.
                Guided: This nonreligious form of meditation can happen with several people or one-on-one. It's a common technique in counseling, therapy and group support settings.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Osho: This form of meditation, also known as “dynamic meditation”, comes from India and has its roots in Hinduism. Breathing exercises are deliberate and forceful.
                Sufi: Sufism is a branch of Islam, and meditation is a common practice among people who follow it.
                Taoist: Like Buddhism, Taoism is also considered a religion and philosophy. It originated in China and is best known through the writings of its founder, Laozi (also spelled “Lao Tzu” or “Lao-Tze”).
                Transcendental: This form of meditation comes from India and is nonreligious. It involves using mantras, which are phrases or words people focus on and repeat aloud or in their minds.
                Yoga: This is a physical form of meditation and exercise from India. It can take on religious and nonreligious forms.</p>
               
              <br> 
               <p> What exactly does meditation do?
                Decreased symptoms of anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
                Improved ability to think, concentrate and solve problems.
                Better ability to adapt to and overcome emotional problems
                Because mental health has a strong impact on the health of your body, those benefits also often bring improvements in how well you sleep, high blood pressure and heart function, and much more.</p>
