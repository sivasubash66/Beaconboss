                    Copra has traditionally been grated and ground, then boiled in water to extract coconut
                    oil.The production of copra removing the shell, breaking it up, drying is usually
                    done where the coconut palms grow.Copra can be made by smoke drying, sun drying, or
                    kiln drying. Hybrid solar drying systems can also be used for a continuous drying
                    process.In a hybrid solar drying system, solar energy is utilized during daylight
                    and energy from burning biomass is used when sunlight is not sufficient or during
                    night.Sun drying requires little more than racks and sufficient sunlight. Halved nuts
                    are drained of water, and left with the meat facing the sky; they can be washed to remove
                    mold-creating contaminants.

                    Copra production begins on coconut plantations. Coconut trees are generally spaced 9m
                    (30 ft) apart, allowing a density of 100-160 coconut trees per hectare. A standard
                    tree bears around 50-80 nuts a year, and average earnings in Vanuatu (1999) were
                    US$0.20 per kg (one kg equals 8 nuts)—so a farmer could earn approximately US$120
                    to US$320 yearly for each planted hectare. Copra has since more than doubled in
                    price, and was quoted at US$540 per ton in the Philippines on a CIF Rotterdam
                    basis (US$0.54 per kg) by the Financial Times on 9 November 2012.

                    In 2017 the value of global exports of copra was $145-146 Million. The largest
                    exporter was Papua New Guinea with 35% of the global total, followed by Indonesia ,
                    Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. The largest importer of copra is the
                    Philippines, which imports $93.4 Million or 64% of the global total. A very large
                    number of small farmers and tree owners produce copra, which is a vital part of
                    their income.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Copra is highly susceptible to the growth of molds and their production of aflatoxins
                if not dried properly. Aflatoxins can be highly toxic, and are among the most potent
                known natural carcinogens, particularly affecting the liver.Aflatoxins in
                copra cake, fed to animals, can be passed on in milk or meat, leading to human illnesses.
